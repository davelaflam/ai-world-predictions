        "summary": "Anthony Elanga scored a stunning solo goal against his former club, Manchester United, to secure a victory for Nottingham Forest. This goal highlighted United's ongoing struggles in the Premier League, where they now sit 13th on the table. Despite dominating possession and shots, United couldn't find an equalizer, thanks to Forest's resilient defense led by Ryan Yates and Murillo. Elanga's goal, reminiscent of feats by legends like Ryan Giggs, underscored Forest's promising form under manager Nuno Espirito Santo, pushing them closer to a Champions League spot.",
